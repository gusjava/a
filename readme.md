# Project's description

The A project is a Java development **multi-applications** project which entirely relies on a **minimalist framework** (the a framework). Its goal is to enable applications development in a scalable and flexible way, with reusable components.

# First step

Compile de src folder and launch the core Main class : *a.core.gus.gyem.GyemMain*.
In order to start a specific application, you should add the following argument : *config=\<app-id\>* 
where *\<app-id\>* is the your target application's ID

Up to now, available IDs are :
- gus.appli1
- gus.devtool1
- gus.allocinesearch

# To go further

Launch the application whose's ID is **gus.devtool1**
